                  The sketch documented below shows the original idea I had for the storybook assignment. I knew I wanted to do something nature/weather as these themes are known for their symbolism and mystery. However I could not figure out how to replicate weather conditions. In turn, I did some research about some symbolic symbols and learned that a sunset is known to mean the end of something usually the long day or a persons life. 
                  Additionally, one can note that one window remains black through the duration of the story. This is meant to symbolize that even with the physical passing of time, mentally sometimes time doesn't pass at all.

                    This is a paragraph section where you can place your writing such as how you framed the project, what inspired you, what kind of research did you do, how did your idea evolve, what were key points of your refinement process, etc. Each paragraph will need to go into a separate paragraph tag.
