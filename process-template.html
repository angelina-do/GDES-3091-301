                <p>
                "The End of Something" is a tribute to the timeless optimism inherent in nature's cycles. It captures the window's ephemeral struggle, symbolizing our own encounters with moments of despair and isolation. Yet, as the sun sets and the world appears to close in, a gentle reminder of resilience and renewal emerges. A subtle spark, a faint glimmer, and suddenly, the window comes back to life, radiating a warm and inviting glow. It is a symbol of our innate ability to find light even in the darkest of times, a testament to the indomitable human spirit.

                  The sketch documented below shows the original idea I had for the storybook assignment. I knew I wanted to do something nature/weather as these themes are known for their symbolism and mystery. However I could not figure out how to replicate weather conditions. In turn, I did some research about some symbolic symbols and learned that a sunset is known to mean the end of something usually the long day or a persons life.

                    Originally, I had planned just to submit my assignment with just the sunset storyline. However, after I received feedback I realized I didn't have a climax to my story.
                    From  here I began to brainstorm, and inevitably was inspired by E3: Fonts and Animation, and created a flickering window in the middle for a climax and resolution.
