          <h2>Process</h2>
          <p>
            Selecting the website design for this content, which is centered around the event "What Comes After the
            Environment?" featuring Naomi Klein and Mirko Zardini, involves a thoughtful process based on the event's
            theme, audience, and the desire to convey relevant information effectively. Here's how I have chosen the
            website design:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Theme and Content Alignment: Given the intellectual and environmentally-focused nature of the event,
              sought a website design that resonated with this theme. Included elements related to nature (jellyfish
              background), reflecting the central themes of the discussion.
            </li>
            <li>Audience Consideration: Considered the target audience for the event. As the event features
              distinguished speakers discussing critical topics, the website design aims for a clean, professional, and
              informative look to appeal to an educated and diverse audience.
            </li>
            <li>Clarity and Readability: Given the importance of conveying event details and information clearly, opted
              for a design that prioritizes readability. Legible fonts, well-structured layouts, and a logical flow of
              information are essential elements.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>I started brainstorming and made a prototype of the poster design in Canva to visualize how I wanted to
              set up the website. This acted as a guide for placement, colours, fonts etc...</p>
