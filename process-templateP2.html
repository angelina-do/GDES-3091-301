            Selecting the website design for this content, which is centered around the event "What Comes After the Environment?" featuring Naomi Klein and Mirko Zardini, involves a thoughtful process based on the event's theme, audience, and the desire to convey relevant information effectively. Here's how I have chosen the website design: 
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Theme and Content Alignment: Given the intellectual and environmentally-focused nature of the event, you likely sought a website design that resonated with this theme. It may have included elements related to sustainability, nature, or architecture, reflecting the central themes of the discussion.
                  </li>
                  <li>Audience Consideration: You probably considered the target audience for the event. As the event features distinguished speakers discussing critical topics, the website design would likely aim for a clean, professional, and informative look to appeal to an educated and diverse audience.               
               </li>
               <li>Clarity and Readability: Given the importance of conveying event details and information clearly, you may have opted for a design that prioritizes readability. Legible fonts, well-structured layouts, and a logical flow of information are essential elements.</li>
              </ol>
