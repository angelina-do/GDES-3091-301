                  1. What is the thesis of this article?<br><br>
                    The thesis of J. R. Carpenter's article revolves around the concept of the "handmade web" as a form of resistance in the digital era. Carpenter argues that the handmade web represents a deliberate, creative, and personal approach to web design and content creation that resists the commercialization, standardization, and corporate takeover of the internet.

                    Carpenter writes that the act of crafting web pages by hand, rather than relying on automated software or conforming to corporate templates, is a means of pushing back against the commercialization of the web. Even Carpenter notes “I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.” 

                    Moreover, the handmade web resists standardization, emphasizing the uniqueness of each web page and encouraging unconventional design and content. It challenges the prevailing trend of uniformity in web design. The article also talks about how the web can feel more real and physical. For example, when you scroll on your phone's screen, it's like turning the pages of a real book. The article says we shouldn't forget that the web can be a real, tangible thing, not just a virtual one.

                    2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?
                  
                    <br><br>I believe three main points that Carpenter notes that are being resisted include: corporate control, standardization and tangibility.

                    Corporate Control: It resists the dominance of big companies over the internet. The handmade web is a way for individuals to create their own digital spaces instead of relying on giant corporations like Facebook or Google.
                    Standardization: It pushes back against the idea that all websites should look and function the same way. Instead, it encourages unique and creative designs and content, resisting the trend of everything becoming too similar online.
                    Tangibility: The handmade web brings attention to the fact that the internet is not just a virtual world but something that can be physically engaging. It resists the idea that the web is disconnected from our physical experiences and argues on how these two worlds can coexist.
                    So, in simpler terms, the handmade web is resisting the control of big companies, resemblance across all websites and challenging the physical disconnect.

                    3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the "physicality" of the web?
                  <br><br>
                    Some personal experiences that I've come across that caught my attention include features like interactive elements. Web games, simulations, or interactive art pieces often require physical movements or actions from users, making the web experience more tactile and hands-on. For example, a popular Korean eyewear brand called "Gentle Monster '' used to have a simulation game on their website to promote their sunglasses collab with Blackpink's Jennie. The stimulation on their site became so successful it eventually evolved into a game downloadable on iOS and Android (https://www.gentlemonster.com/int/stories/jentle-garden/gameLinks to an external site.). “Welcome to Jentle Garden, a fantasy world created by Gentle Monster and BLACKPINK’s Jennie. Grow your own Flower Garden with Jennie and explore the collection”. Users were able to explore elements of the celebrity's limited-edition eyewear collection in the style of a video game (think Stardew Valley). You were able to visit different areas to see galleries of the collection and they even created a mini-game based on the theme of the collaboration.
