                  Inspired by the duality of day and night, light and darkness, the website unfolds a visual narrative as the user engages with the sun. The sun, symbolizing the cycle of day, transforms seamlessly into the moon upon ascending the digital horizon. This transition triggers a mesmerizing shift in the website's aesthetic, bathing the scene in vibrant hues during daylight and transitioning into a nocturnal dreamscape as night falls.
